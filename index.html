    <p>Porpoises are a group of fully aquatic marine mammals, similar in appearance to a dolphin, all of which
        are classified under the family Phocoenidae, parvorder Odontoceti (toothed whales). They are, however, more
        closely related to narwhals and belugas than to the true dolphins.[1] There are eight extant species of
        porpoise, all among the smallest of the toothed whales. Porpoises are distinguished from dolphins by their
        flattened, spade-shaped teeth distinct from the conical teeth of dolphins, and lack of a pronounced beak,
        although some dolphins (e.g. Hector's dolphin) also lack a pronounced beak. Porpoises, and other cetaceans,
        belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates, and their closest living relatives are the
        hippopotamuses, having diverged from them about 40 million years ago.

        Porpoises range in size from the vaquita, at 1.4 metres (4 feet 7 inches) in length and 54 kilograms (119
        pounds) in weight, to the Dall's porpoise, at 2.3 m (7 ft 7 in) and 220 kg (490 lb). Several species exhibit
        sexual dimorphism in that the females are larger than males. They have streamlined bodies and two limbs that
        are modified into flippers. Porpoises use echolocation as their primary sensory system. Some species are
        well adapted for diving to great depths. As all cetaceans, they have a layer of fat, or blubber, under the
        skin to keep them warm in cold water.

        Porpoises are abundant and found in a multitude of environments, including rivers (finless porpoise),
        coastal and shelf waters (harbour porpoise, vaquita) and open ocean (Dall's porpoise and spectacled
        porpoise), covering all water temperatures from tropical (Sea of Cortez, vaquita) to polar (Greenland,
        harbour porpoise). Porpoises feed largely on fish and squid, much like the rest of the odontocetes. Little
        is known about reproductive behaviour. Females may get one calf every year under favourable
        conditions.[2][3] Calves are typically born in the spring and summer months and remain dependent on the
        female until the following spring. Porpoises produce ultrasonic clicks, which are used for both navigation
        (echolocation) and social communication. In contrast to many dolphin species, porpoises do not form large
        social groups.

        Porpoises were, and still are, hunted by some countries by means of drive hunting. Larger threats to
        porpoises include extensive bycatch in gill nets, competition for food from fisheries, and marine pollution,
        in particular heavy metals and organochlorides. The vaquita nearly became extinct in the twentieth century,
        due to bycatch in gill nets, with a predicted population of fewer than 100 individuals. Since the extinction
        of the baiji, the vaquita is considered the most endangered cetacean. Some species of porpoises have been
        and are kept in captivity and trained for research, education and public display.

    <p>Return to Monke encompasses a series of memes closely associated with anarcho-primitivism that romanticize
        simplistic archaic lifestyle, with apes (often referred to as monkeys or monkes) serving as a symbolic
        representation of that lifestyle. The meme often features intentionally simplified language and is closely
        associated with similar traditionalist memes such as Reject Modernity, Return to Tradition and Consume Product.

    <p>Chunky Kong is a character from the game Donkey Kong 64 for Nintendo 64. As stated by the song in the game
        opening cutscene, the DK Rap, he is the biggest and strongest member of the Kong Family.

        Chunky Kong is the older brother of Kiddy Kong, making him also Dixie's and Tiny's cousin.

        In Donkey Kong 64, he (like Donkey Kong) speaks in third person since he does not seem very bright. He also does
        not seem to favor fighting unless he has to go protect others. Chunky Kong enjoys wrestling, butterflies,
        ballet, and playing the triangle.

        His first appearance (along with Lanky and Tiny Kong) as a playable character was in Donkey Kong 64,
        specifically being the fifth and therefore last unlockable Kong. His voice in Donkey Kong 64 was provided by
        Chris Sutherland. </p>
