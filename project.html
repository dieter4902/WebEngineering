            <p>Porpoises are a group of fully aquatic marine mammals, similar in appearance to a dolphin, all of
                which
                are classified under the family Phocoenidae, parvorder Odontoceti (toothed whales). They are,
                however,
                more
                closely related to narwhals and belugas than to the true dolphins. There are eight extant species of
                porpoise, all among the smallest of the toothed whales. Porpoises are distinguished from dolphins by
                their
                flattened, spade-shaped teeth distinct from the conical teeth of dolphins, and lack of a pronounced
                beak,
                although some dolphins (e.g. Hector's dolphin) also lack a pronounced beak. Porpoises, and other
                cetaceans,
                belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates, and their closest living relatives are
                the
                hippopotamuses, having diverged from them about 40 million years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
                Porpoises range in size from the vaquita, at 1.4 metres (4 feet 7 inches) in length and 54 kilograms
                (119
                pounds) in weight, to the Dall's porpoise, at 2.3 m (7 ft 7 in) and 220 kg (490 lb). Several species
                exhibit
                sexual dimorphism in that the females are larger than males. They have streamlined bodies and two
                limbs
                that
                are modified into flippers. Porpoises use echolocation as their primary sensory system. Some species
                are
                well adapted for diving to great depths. As all cetaceans, they have a layer of fat, or blubber,
                under
                the
                skin to keep them warm in cold water.
            </p>
            <p>
                Porpoises are abundant and found in a multitude of environments, including rivers (finless
                porpoise),
                coastal and shelf waters (harbour porpoise, vaquita) and open ocean (Dall's porpoise and spectacled
                porpoise), covering all water temperatures from tropical (Sea of Cortez, vaquita) to polar
                (Greenland,
                harbour porpoise). Porpoises feed largely on fish and squid, much like the rest of the odontocetes.
                Little
                is known about reproductive behaviour. Females may get one calf every year under favourable
                conditions. Calves are typically born in the spring and summer months and remain dependent on the
                female until the following spring. Porpoises produce ultrasonic clicks, which are used for both
                navigation
                (echolocation) and social communication. In contrast to many dolphin species, porpoises do not form
                large
                social groups.
            </p>
            <p>

                Porpoises were, and still are, hunted by some countries by means of drive hunting. Larger threats to
                porpoises include extensive bycatch in gill nets, competition for food from fisheries, and marine
                pollution,
                in particular heavy metals and organochlorides. The vaquita nearly became extinct in the twentieth
                century,
                due to bycatch in gill nets, with a predicted population of fewer than 100 individuals. Since the
                extinction
                of the baiji, the vaquita is considered the most endangered cetacean. Some species of porpoises have
                been
                and are kept in captivity and trained for research, education and public display.

            <img src="img/chonk_chart.png" alt="mighty chonky bbois">
            <p>The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated
                species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from
                the
                wild
                members of the family. A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges
                freely and avoids human contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their
                ability
                to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.
            </p>
            <p>

                The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick
                reflexes,
                sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and sense of smell
                are
                well developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing,
                growling
                and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. A predator that is most active at dawn and dusk
                (crepuscular), the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species. It can hear sounds too faint or
                too
                high
                in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals. It secretes and
                perceives pheromones.
            </p>
            <p>

                Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging
                from
                two
                to five kittens. Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby
                known
                as cat fancy. Population control of cats may be effected by spaying and neutering, but their
                proliferation
                and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to
                the
                extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species.

            <p>Return to Monke encompasses a series of memes closely associated with anarcho-primitivism that
                romanticize
                simplistic archaic lifestyle, with apes (often referred to as monkeys or monkes) serving as a
                symbolic
                representation of that lifestyle. The meme often features intentionally simplified language and is
                closely
                associated with similar traditionalist memes such as Reject Modernity, Return to Tradition and
                Consume
                Product.
